\section{Testing Setup}
Two receivers, with and without correction message input.
Both can log data.
Reference station with antenna pole, GPS receiver, laptop and XBee module.
Software to visualize data.

\section{Static Accuracy Test}
Compare GPS positioning accuracy with and without correction messages to see if the accuracy is improved.
The reference receiver measures the reference position over some hours.
The rover is at a fixed and though Google Maps known location.
The variance and bias are observed in both cases.

Is the bias improved?
Is the variance improved?

\section{Mobile Accuracy Test}
Two receivers test while the rover is moving.
A route is walked which was predetermined with Google Maps.

How accurate is the system when the rover is moving?

\section{Distance Test}
Two receiver test with a horizontal distance of about 3km between rover and reference station.

Does DGPS still improve the accuracy if the rover is 3km away from the reference station?

\section{Height Difference Test}

Two receiver test with the rover on a mountain which is about 3km higher than the reference station in the valley.

How much impact does the tropospheric height effect have on the DGPS accuracy?
