\chapter{GPS Concept and Error Sources}

Along with earlier navigation systems, this chapter explains the positioning concept of GPS and modern Global Navigation Satellite Systems(GNSS) in general.
The error sources that impact the accuracy of GPS are listed and split into categories that determine in which segment those errors occur.

\section{Predecessors}
Before there was GPS, other systems that were mostly ground based and limited to a certan area were used to navigate.
