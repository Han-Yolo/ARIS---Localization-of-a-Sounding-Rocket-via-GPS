# Overview
This program generates differential GPS correction messages from a u-blox M8T GPS receiver. 
It is a Qt project that was created with Qt Creator 4.6.0 and Qt version 5.10.1 on Linux Mint.

# Function
The receiver is connected to the laptop over USB. 
A serial port is used to communicate with the receiver.
The correction messages follow the RTCM 2.3 standard. 
Message 1 and 3 are generated.
They are then sent to the XBee ground station interface from where they are transmitted to the rocket.

# ToDo
* improve pseudorange corrections (receiver clock offset estimation)
* implement XBee interface when it is defined from the ground station side (messages can be sent out over a serial port at the moment)
